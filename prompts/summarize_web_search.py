SUMMARIZE_WEB_SEARCH = """You are creating a minimal summary for research steering - your goal is to help an agent know what information it has collected, NOT to preserve all details.

<webpage_content>
{webpage_content}
</webpage_content>

Create a VERY CONCISE summary focusing on:
1. Main topic/subject in 1-2 sentences
2. Key information type (facts, tutorial, news, analysis, etc.)  
3. Most significant 1-2 findings or points

Keep the summary under 150 words total. The agent needs to know what's in this file to decide if it should search for more information or use this source.

Generate a descriptive filename that indicates the content type and topic (e.g., "mcp_protocol_overview.md", "ai_safety_research_2024.md").

Output format:
```json
{{
   "filename": "descriptive_filename.md",
   "summary": "Very brief summary under 150 words focusing on main topic and key findings"
}}
```
